# Philips CDi

## Overview

- Core: `same_cdi`
- Path(s): `cdi`
- Supported Extensions: `.chd`
- Bios: `cdmono1.zip`

## Bios

The bios file `cdmono1.zip` is part of the MAME 0.239 romset. It should be put in `/roms/bios/same_cdi/bios/cdmono1.zip`. The file may also be called `cdmono1.7z`.

## ROM Sets

The CDi uses MAME roms, though it's a bit different than most MAME systems because it only requires the `.chd` file, and not an accompanying `.zip` file. Currently, we recommend that you use roms compatible with the MAME 0.239 romset.

## Digital Video Cartridge games

The same_cdi emulator does not currently support DVC games.
