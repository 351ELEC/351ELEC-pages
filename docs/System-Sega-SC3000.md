### blueMSX (default)

BlueMSX requires two folders, 'Databases' and 'Machines', that are available from the zip for the full version of blueMSX for windows. Go to the [blueMSX Download Page](http://bluemsx.msxblue.com/download.html). Ignore the radio select and "Download" button, and click on the link labled `blueMSXvYYYfull.zip`, where `YYY` is the current version number.
