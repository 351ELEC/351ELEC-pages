## Controls

Some games on the Odyssey have multiple variants of the game on the cartridge. When they boot up, a Select Game screen will be displayed. You choose the game by using the 1-4 numeric keys, either using the controller buttons mapped to numeric keys or using the onscreen keyboard.

The onscreen keyboard uses the Action key to press the keyboard button. There's no indication that the button has been pressed on the keyboard itself.

Unfortunately, non-numeric keyboard buttons can't be mapped to controller buttons. This means that most games that control with the keyboard rather than the joystick will be unplayable.
