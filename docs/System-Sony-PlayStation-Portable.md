|Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together   |PPSSPPSDL             | Buffered Rendering=1 <br>Block transfer effects=0<br>Frame skipping=2<br>Auto frameskip=1<br> Force Max FPS 60<br>CPU clock=0 | Playable; Gameplay is almost glitchless, the only downside is on certain cutscenes which drop FPS to around 15-30fps and the game intro/player creation, these problems does not happen with the stock firmware, beyond that it's stable. |
