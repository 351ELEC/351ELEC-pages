## Add Support for The Voice Speech Synthesis Module

1. Go to the O2EM project homepage and download both sound sample sets.
2. On your GAMES partition, inside the `BIOS` directory, create a `voice` directory and unzip the contents of both zip files into it.
3. Test to make sure it's working.  The game "K.C.'s Kracy Chase' is a quick and easy way to test the functionality as it plays voice samples at the start of gameplay and regularly throughout.
