## Controls

As with a lot of computer emulation on pad only devices, the controls can vary widely and cause some trouble trying to play games.

The default controls for the emulators are:

| Button             | CrocoDS           | Caprice32         |
|--------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| A                  | X                 | X                 |
| B                  | Z                 | Z                 |
| X                  | 2                 | N/A               |
| Y                  | 3                 | N/A               |
| Start              | Return            | N/A               |
| Select             | CrocoDS Menu      | N/A               |
| R1                 | Onscreen Keyboard | Return            |
| R2                 | 7                 | 2                 |
| L1                 | Overscan Cropping | N/A               |
| L2                 | 6                 | 1                 |
| Start + Select*    | N/A               | Onscreen Keyboard |

\* This can cause issues, since the quit command for 351Elec is pressing Start+Select twice
