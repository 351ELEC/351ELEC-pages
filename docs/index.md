Our Italian devs love Hawaiian Pizza so much, we've decided to become PineappleELEC! We've also added support for installing on the [AnanasBoy](images/ananasboy.jpeg), the open source gaming hardware powered by a pineapple battery! You can download it from the [Download Page](Download). Make sure you download the correct version for your device.
