# Unsupported Ports

While 351ELEC has a number of [official ports](Supported-Emulators-and-Ports#ports) and [official packages](Supported-Emulators-and-Ports#community-built-packages), it is possible to get some other ports running on the system. These usually take considerably more effort to get running, though, and if you run into problems it's unlikely that any 351ELEC team members will know how to help you get it running.

That said, this page lists some other ports that have been known to run, and gives instructions on how to run them. Please be aware that these instructions may be out of date or may not be 100% correct, and the 351ELEC team may not know how to help you if you can't get them running.

Feel free to add ports that you've gotten running here, or even better to put them together into a [Community Package](Contributing-to-351ELEC#contributing-community-built-packages) so that other people have an easier time installing them in the future.
