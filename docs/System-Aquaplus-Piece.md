# Aquaplus P/ECE

## Overview

- Cores:
  - `piemu` (default)
- Path(s): piece
- Supported Extensions: `.pex .pfi .pfs`

Piemu **does not currently support saved games**. This is a limitation of the emulator.

## BIOS

The Aquaplus P/ECE requires a bios file that is freely available from their website. It's strongly recommended that you use version 1.18, as there are many games that do a version check and only recognize 1.1x versions.

To get the bios file, download one of the following software packages. These packages are released as a self-extracting lzh file, so you can either run the exe (if you're on Windows), or you can change the name to update\*.lzh and unzip it wherever you'd like. The BIOS will be in a folder called `update`, and is named `all.bin`. Add this file to your 351ELEC bios folder.

## Game files

Games for the P/ECE come as `.pex` files. For many games, this file will be enough to run the game. There are some games that come packaged with a `.pfs` file. These games have dependencies, and require you to add the `.pex` file, the `.pfs` file, and any other file listed in the `.pfs` file to your games directory.

Piemu also supports loading hard drive images, which are `pfi` files. These files can be added to your piece directory the same way that `.pex` files are.

## Finding games

The P/ece is an open source console, made to be community driven, and as such most of the software and games are legally available for free online. Aquaplus hosted a few game development competitions, and all of the entrants can be found on their website. In addition, Aquaplus released a few free games themselves, and various developers hosted games on their own websites.

Below are a few places to download free P/ECE games. Many of the websites and links are older and may have fallen off the internet, so if you see a game you're interested in with a dead link, please check if the site was archived in the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/).
