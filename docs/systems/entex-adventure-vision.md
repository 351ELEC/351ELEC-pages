The Entex Adventure Vision requires the BIOS file `advision.zip` from the current version of the MAME romset. The bios can be added to `/roms/bios` or `/roms/bios/mame`. Alternately, if you already have a full MAME romset in `/roms/mame`, the bios can be read from that folder.

> # CAUTION
>
> This exciting game uses the latest Entex Electronics technology, and a slight amount of flicker may be noticed during game play. This is normal and to be expected.
> 
> For the best game play, use in a darkened room. Should not be used in areas lighted by fluorescent fixtures.
>
> When switching game from ON, to OFF, and back ON again, allow a few seconds in the OFF position, to permit the microprocessor time to reset; otherwise, the screen will appear completely red.
