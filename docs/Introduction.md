# Introduction

Welcome! Whether you already have an RG351 device or you're looking to get one, we're happy that you've found us.

## About the RG351

The RG351 is a retro handheld device made by Anbernic. It's a device to play old video games on in style. There are three different models of the RG351: The P, the M, and the V. The P and M are landscape devices, and are very similar in most ways. The only differences are that the P is made of plastic and does not have internal wifi, and the M is made of metal and does come with internal wifi. The V is a portrait device (think a kind of weird Game Boy). The V is made of plastic, but like the M it has internal wifi. Both the P and the M have two analogue sticks, while the V only has a single analogue stick. The P and M have 3:2 screens (think Gameboy Advance), and the V has a 4:3 screen (think CRT televisions).

### Capabilities

All three of these devices run on the same chipset, the rk3326, and because of that all three of them are equally good at emulation. 351 devices will generally play 8 and 16 bit consoles without trouble (Nintendo, Super Nintendo, Mastersystem, and Mega Drive/Genesis). They play handhelds up through Game Boy Advance without issue (though a few harder GBA games may have sound issues). The vast majority of PS1 games play well on 351 devices. DS games also generally play well, though games that require the touch screen can be a problem, and displaying both screens at once makes them pretty small.

N64 games, Dreamcast games and Saturn games don't generally play well on 351 devices. Some of the easier to emulate games will run at full speed or nearly full speed, but most games will have issues and many will be unplayable.
