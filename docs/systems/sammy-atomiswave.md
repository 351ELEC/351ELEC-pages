# Sammy Atomiswave

## Overview

- Core: `flycast`
- Path(s): `atomiswave`
- Supported Extensions: `.zip .7z .lst .bin .dat`

The Atomiswave is an arcade system by Sammy based on the Sega Dreamcast hardware. While the games are stored as MAME roms, they run significantly better under the `flycast` emulator, so they've been put into a different system folder as a workaround.

## ROM Sets

Atomiswave uses MAME roms. Currently, we recommend that you use roms compatible with the `MAME 0.235` romset. Please see the [Arcade](/guides/arcade) page for more information on creating romsets.
