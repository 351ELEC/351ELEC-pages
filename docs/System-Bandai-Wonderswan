## Screen Rotation

The Bandai Wonderswan was a unique handheld that had three sets of buttons, allowing games to be made for either portrait or landscape mode. The easiest way to accomodate this in emulation is to reorient portrait games so that they are vertical on the screen. This leaves large black bars on the left and right side of the game, but it's probably ergonomically easier.
