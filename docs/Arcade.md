# Arcade Emulation

## Overview

Arcade emulation is more complicated than most other emulation. For most other emulation, if you have an emulator and a good rom file, you're ready to play. Even some bad rom files will work just fine. With arcade emulation, the romsets are specific to the emulator that you're using, and there are multiple different types of romsets that may or may not work.

The short version is that you should use "Non-Merged" romsets that are built for the specific version of the emulator that you're going to run them on.

If you want a better understanding of how arcade emulation works, the MAME [About ROMs and Sets](https://docs.mamedev.org/usingmame/aboutromsets.html) documentation explains the subject in detail. Specifically, the [Parents, Clones, Splitting, and Merging](https://docs.mamedev.org/usingmame/aboutromsets.html#parents-clones-splitting-and-merging) section should explain why you want to use "Non-Merged" romsets.
