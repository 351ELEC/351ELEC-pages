# Anberports

Anberports is a dead project that was created by a third party developer. If you want to use a port installer, please consider using [PortMaster](PortMaster) instead. Anberports never had full compatibility with AmberElec, and it has even less compatibility now. If you aren't willing to debug with ssh and install missing libraries, there's very little from Anberports you'll be able to get running.

That said, if you want to tinker with Anberports to see if you can get it working, feel free to download it from the [Anberports Download Page](https://github.com/sponsors/krishenriksen) and play around. Because of AmberElec's read only filesystem, Anberports can't do anything to break your install, so you can tinker without worry. And if you'd like to contribute the results of your tinkering as a [AmberElec Package](Contributing-to-AmberElec#contributing-community-built-packages), that would be awesome.
