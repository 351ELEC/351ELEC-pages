Collections allow you to organize your games so that they're easy to find and browse.

## Dynamic Collections

Dynamic Game Collections use game metadata to sort games into useful categories without having to go through and pick each individual game. Dynamic collections rely on metadata that's downloaded when you scrape your roms, so they only work for roms that have been scraped. You can create Dynamic Collections based on nearly any metadata field that's available; for instance, you could create a collection of every game released in 1991, or a collection of every game developed by Square. You can even combine multiple filters to create more complex collections; for instance you could create a collection of games that have achievements, that you haven't already played, and that were released in 1997.

You can create Dynamic Collections by going into [Game Collection Settings](menus#game-collection-settings) and choosing `Create New Dynamic Collection`.

### Automatic Game Collections

Automatic Game Collections are dynamic collections that are built into the system. They cover a lot of common use cases for Dynamic Collections. To activate an Automatic Game Collection, open [Game Collection Settings](menus#game-collection-settings) and select the Automatic Collections that you want in the `Automatic Game Collections` menu.

There are three categories of automatic game collections:

- Automatic Game Collections: Generally useful collections
- Per Genre: Each genre that exists in your games' metadata will have its own auto-collection
- Arcade Systems: Individual collections for each arcade board you have games for. This includes collections for the popular Capcom CPS systems

## Editable Collections

Editable Game Collections are collections that you can add games to individually. These collections are useful for collecting the games of a long running series with games on many platforms, or for creating collections based on things that the metadata doesn't capture.

You can create Editable Collections by going into [Game Collection Settings](menus#game-collection-settings) and choosing `Create New Editable Collection`.
